config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  CPU Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of 
	  CPUs on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because 
	  the lower the CPU clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  Note that this driver doesn't automatically change the CPU
	  clock speed, you need to either enable a dynamic cpufreq governor
	  (see below) after boot, or use a userspace tool.

	  For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq>.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_STAT
	tristate "CPU frequency translation statistics"
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	default y
	help
	  This driver exports CPU frequency statistics information through sysfs
	  file system.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpufreq_stats.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_STAT_DETAILS
	bool "CPU frequency translation statistics details"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_STAT
	help
	  This will show detail CPU frequency translation table in sysfs file
	  system.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	prompt "Default CPUFreq governor"
	default CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_USERSPACE if CPU_FREQ_SA1100 || CPU_FREQ_SA1110
	default CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	help
	  This option sets which CPUFreq governor shall be loaded at
	  startup. If in doubt, select 'performance'.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	bool "performance"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'performance' as default. This sets
	  the frequency statically to the highest frequency supported by
	  the CPU.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_POWERSAVE
	bool "powersave"
	depends on EXPERT
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_POWERSAVE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'powersave' as default. This sets
	  the frequency statically to the lowest frequency supported by
	  the CPU.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_USERSPACE
	bool "userspace"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_USERSPACE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'userspace' as default. This allows
	  you to set the CPU frequency manually or when a userspace 
	  program shall be able to set the CPU dynamically without having
	  to enable the userspace governor manually.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_ONDEMAND
	bool "ondemand"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_ONDEMAND
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'ondemand' as default. This allows
	  you to get a full dynamic frequency capable system by simply
	  loading your cpufreq low-level hardware driver.
	  Be aware that not all cpufreq drivers support the ondemand
	  governor. If unsure have a look at the help section of the
	  driver. Fallback governor will be the performance governor.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_STOCKDEMAND
	bool "stockdemand"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_STOCKDEMAND
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'stockdemand' as default. This allows
	  you to get a full dynamic frequency capable system by simply
	  loading your cpufreq low-level hardware driver.
	  Be aware that not all cpufreq drivers support the ondemand
	  governor. If unsure have a look at the help section of the
	  driver. Fallback governor will be the performance governor.
	  This is default LG ondemand cpu gov.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_CONSERVATIVE
	bool "conservative"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_CONSERVATIVE
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'conservative' as default. This allows
	  you to get a full dynamic frequency capable system by simply
	  loading your cpufreq low-level hardware driver.
	  Be aware that not all cpufreq drivers support the conservative
	  governor. If unsure have a look at the help section of the
	  driver. Fallback governor will be the performance governor.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_INTERACTIVE
	bool "interactive"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_INTERACTIVE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'interactive' as default. This allows
	  you to get a full dynamic cpu frequency capable system by simply
	  loading your cpufreq low-level hardware driver, using the
	  'interactive' governor for latency-sensitive workloads.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_INTELLIACTIVE
	bool "intelliactive"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_INTELLIACTIVE
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'intelliactive' as default. This allows
	  you to get a full dynamic cpu frequency capable system by simply
	  loading your cpufreq low-level hardware driver, using the
	  'interactive' governor for latency-sensitive workloads.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_INTELLIDEMAND
	bool "intellidemand"
	select CPU_FREQ_GOV_INTELLIDEMAND
	help
	  Use the CPUFreq governor 'ondemand' as default. This allows
	  you to get a full dynamic frequency capable system by simply
	  loading your cpufreq low-level hardware driver.

config CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_SMARTMAX
        bool "smartmax"
        select CPU_FREQ_GOV_SMARTMAX
        help
          Use the CPUFreq governor 'smartmax' as default
